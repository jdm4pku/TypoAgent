want to edit the deal terms only while the deal is in Offer Created so I can adjust the offer before a buyer commits.\n\nFeature5: As a buyer, I want to accept an existing offer so the deal moves from Offer Created to Accepted and both parties are committed to proceed.\n\nFeature6: As a buyer, I want to cancel the deal only before I fund the escrow so I can back out safely if I change my mind prior to payment.\n\nFeature7: As a seller, I want to cancel the deal only before the buyer has accepted so I can withdraw an offer that I no longer wish to honor.\n\nFeature8: As a buyer, I want to fund the escrow by depositing cryptocurrency so the deal transitions to Funded and the seller knows funds are locked.\n\nFeature9: As a seller, I want the deal to move to In Progress once funds are in escrow so I know I can safely deliver the agreed cryptocurrency or service.\n\nFeature10: As a buyer, I want to confirm successful delivery/completion so the deal transitions to Completed and the escrow releases funds to the seller.\n\nFeature11: As a buyer or seller, I want to open a dispute after the deal is Funded if something goes wrong so an admin/arbitrator can review and resolve it.\n\nFeature12: As an admin/arbitrator, I want to resolve disputes by choosing to release all funds to the seller, refund all funds to the buyer, or split funds between them so I can handle different dispute outcomes.\n\nFeature13: As an admin/arbitrator, I want to be the only role allowed to finalize fund movements in a disputed deal so that dispute resolutions are controlled and authoritative.\n\nFeature14: As a buyer or seller, I want all escrow deposits and releases to use unique per-deal escrow addresses or identifiers so accounting and security are clear and isolated per deal.\n\nFeature15: As a buyer or seller, I want to use BTC, ETH, and major ERC‑20 tokens (USDT, USDC, DAI) for escrow so I can transact with commonly used assets.\n\nFeature16: As a buyer or seller, I want optional support for USDT on Tron if feasible so I can use that network for lower fees (TBD).\n\nFeature17: As a buyer or seller, I want to see on my deal page the exact cryptocurrency/network used, the deposit address, and any required memo/tag so I know how to deposit correctly.\n\nFeature18: As a buyer or seller, I want to view my active and past deals in a dashboard so I can quickly track what’s in progress and what’s completed.\n\nFeature19: As a buyer or seller, I want to open any deal from the dashboard to see full details (terms, parties, amounts, fees, addresses) so I can review the agreement at any time.\n\nFeature20: As a buyer or seller, I want to see the current status of each deal prominently (Offer Created, Accepted, Funded, In Progress, Completed, Disputed, etc.) so I always know where I am in the process.\n\nFeature21: As a buyer or seller, I want to see on‑chain confirmation status for deposits and releases with direct links to blockchain explorers so I can independently verify transactions.\n\nFeature22: As a buyer or seller, I want to download a simple receipt or history for each deal (timestamps, amounts, fees, addresses, tx hashes) so I have documentation for my records.\n\nFeature23: As a user, I want to sign up and log in using email and password so I can access the platform without needing a crypto wallet or SSO initially.\n\nFeature24: As an admin/arbitrator, I want to log in with an admin role so I can perform dispute resolution and administrative actions that normal users cannot.\n\nFeature25: As an operator, I want KYC to be optional and not required before creating or joining escrow deals so users can start using the system without identity verification at this stage.\n\nFeature26: As a user, I want the system to maintain basic records of each deal’s status changes, related on‑chain transactions, and dispute actions with timestamps so there is a minimal history available for support.\n\nFeature27: As a buyer or seller, I want to see a simple timeline or log on each deal showing state changes and dispute actions so I can understand what has happened and when.\n\nFeature28: As an admin, I want to view the same history log for any deal so I can investigate issues and support users more effectively.\n\nFeature29: As an operator, I want the system to retain deal histories for at least a couple of years so support can reference older transactions when necessary.\n\nFeature30: As a buyer or seller, I want each history entry to show who performed the action (buyer, seller, or admin), the timestamp, the previous and new status, any relevant tx hash/link, and an optional comment so I have meaningful context for each change.\n\nFeature31: As a buyer or seller, I want the platform to clearly distinguish dispute-related entries (opening, resolving, admin decisions) in the history so I can follow how the dispute was handled.\n\nFeature32: As a user, I want the app to use a dark theme with a near‑black/charcoal main background (e.g., #0F1115) and slightly lighter dark gray for cards/panels (e.g., #171A21) so content is readable and visually separated.\n\nFeature33: As a user, I want the primary UI accent color (buttons, links, status badges) to be a dark red/deep burgundy so the interface matches the desired visual style.\n\nFeature34: As a user, I want success, error, and warning states to use standard, clearly distinguishable colors (green for success, strong red/orange for error/warning) with good contrast on the dark background so I can quickly understand outcomes and issues.\n\nFeature35: As a user, I want hover, active/pressed, and disabled states of buttons and key controls to be visually distinct but consistent with the dark red accent and neutral grays so interactions feel clear and coherent.\n\nFeature36: As a user, I want the core UI components (buttons, form inputs, cards, typography, spacing, icons, and status badges) to follow a consistent design system so the app feels cohesive and easy to navigate.\n\nFeature37: As a user, I want text and key UI elements to have sufficient contrast against the dark background so I can read and interact with the app comfortably, even without strict WCAG targeting.",

(TBD)  \nFeature12: As a user, I want to add notes to a workout so I can capture context like how I felt or what to change next time.  \nFeature13: As a user, I want to see a brief comparison of a workout vs recent similar workouts so I can gauge relative performance.  \nFeature14: As a user, I want to create/edit workouts on a single screen with collapsible sections so data entry is fast but organized.  \nFeature15: As a user, I want to select an activity type at the top and add/edit exercises in a list below so I can log both strength and cardio sessions.  \nFeature16: As a user, I want the app to remember my last-used settings so repeated logging is faster.  \nFeature17: As a user, I want to save and load workout templates so I can reuse routines and only tweak details.  \nFeature18: As a user, I want bulk-edit actions for an exercise (e.g., apply rest time/weight/notes to all sets) so I can update repetitive fields quickly.  \nFeature19: As a user, I want to duplicate an exercise within a workout so I can make small variations without re-entering everything.  \nFeature20: As a user, I want a basic exercise list/library to choose from when building workouts so exercise entry is consistent.  \nFeature21: As a user, I want optional tags (and simple goals/targets) so I can categorize workouts and track progress against targets. (TBD)  \nFeature22: As a user, I want a Progress/Reports page showing strength analytics like total volume and sets per muscle group so I can understand training balance over time.  \nFeature23: As a user, I want Progress/Reports to show estimated 1RM trends and personal bests over time so I can track strength improvements.  \nFeature24: As a user, I want Progress/Reports to show cardio analytics like distance, pace, and time in heart-rate zones (when HR exists) so I can track endurance progress.  \nFeature25: As a user, I want time-range controls (last week, last month, last 3 months, custom range) so I can analyze different periods.  \nFeature26: As a user, I want filters on reports (by activity type and tag) so I can focus analysis on specific training.  \nFeature27: As a user, I want line charts for trends and bar charts for weekly/monthly totals so insights are easy to interpret.  \nFeature28: As a user, I want simple comparison views (e.g., this week vs last, current 4-week block vs previous) so I can evaluate recent changes.  \nFeature29: As a user, I want a clean, modern UI with blue accent color (default #2563EB) so the interface feels consistent and polished.  \nFeature30: As a user, I want high-contrast, readable UI in both light mode and dark mode so I can use the app comfortably in different environments.",

(TBD)\n\nFeature11: As a user, I want advanced or detailed media settings to live in a side panel so that the preview stays clean and only exposes the most frequently used controls.\n\nFeature12: As a user, I want the tool to manage reusable HTML/CSS/JS snippets, components, and full-page templates so I can quickly assemble pages from existing building blocks.\n\nFeature13: As a user, I want the tool to manage reusable media assets (logos, icons, hero images, and selected audio/video files) so I can easily reuse brand and common media across content.\n\nFeature14: As a user, I want to organize reusable content and media by project or workspace so I can separate materials for different sites or clients.\n\nFeature15: As a user, I want folders and tags for organizing reusable snippets, templates, components, and media so I can quickly filter and find what I need.\n\nFeature16: As a user, I want a “favorites” and/or “recently used” view for reusable items so I can access my most common assets and snippets quickly.\n\nFeature17: As a user, I want to optionally mark some snippets, templates, and media as global assets so they can be reused across multiple projects/workspaces.\n\nFeature18: As a user, I want a simple “restore previous version” history for snippets and templates so I can rollback changes if I break something.\n\nFeature19: As a user, I do not need complex versioning features such as detailed comparison views or formal “stable release” workflows in the reusable libraries.\n\nFeature20: As a user, I want to browse media assets in a way that clearly shows what each asset is (e.g., list, gallery, or combination) so I can identify the correct file at a glance.\n\nFeature21: As a user, I want to be able to insert any media asset I’m browsing into my content with minimal steps (e.g., click-to-insert or drag-and-drop) so the workflow feels frictionless.\n\nFeature22: As a user, I want a light UI with fairly high contrast so I can work comfortably for long sessions without eye strain.\n\nFeature23: As a user, I want the UI to use a standard, accessibility-compliant blue as the single accent/highlight color (for links, active states, focus outlines) so interactive states are clear and readable.\n\nFeature24: As a user, I want the editor/main canvas background to be a honeydew color so the primary editing area is visually distinct and pleasant.\n\nFeature25: As a user, I want sidebars and toolbars to use a very light gray/neutral background so they are visually separate from the main canvas while staying consistent with the overall design.\n\nFeature26: As a user, I want key UI components (buttons, cards, navigation bars) to use a dark olive green base so the interface has a cohesive visual identity.\n\nFeature27: As a user, I want buttons, cards, and navigation bars to use white or light-gray surfaces where needed for text and icon readability so information remains legible on dark olive green bases.\n\nFeature28: As a user, I want focus and active states to be clearly indicated using the accessible blue accent over the dark olive green and light backgrounds so I can easily see which element is active.\n\nFeature29: As a user, I want the overall color system to respect basic accessibility contrast guidelines so the interface is usable and readable.\n\nFeature30: As a user, I want the tool to support switching to a dark theme so I can adjust the environment to my lighting conditions and personal preference.",
