figures.\n\nFeature3: As a user, I want to select a company by name or ID before entering or viewing financial data so that I always know which entity I am working on.\n\nFeature4: As a user, I want to select a period (month or quarter with start and end dates) for a given company so that data is always tied to a clear time range.\n\nFeature5: As a user, I want to input revenue per company per period so that I can track top-line performance.\n\nFeature6: As a user, I want to specify the currency for each company-period record so that financial data is clearly denominated.\n\nFeature7: As a user, I want notes or adjustment comments to be stored as an optional field per company-period record so that I can document context or changes.\n\nFeature8: As a user, I want to capture expenses per company per period broken into categories (payroll, COGS, rent, marketing, other) so that I can analyze costs in a structured way.\n\nFeature9: As a user, I want the system to store and show total expenses per company per period so that I can quickly see overall spend.\n\nFeature10: As a user, I want the system to calculate and display profit (revenue minus total expenses) per company per period so that I can see bottom-line performance.\n\nFeature11: As a user, I want the system to calculate and display gross margin percentage per company per period so that I can assess profitability relative to revenue.\n\nFeature12: As a user, I want to upload financial data via CSV or Excel files for selected companies and periods so that I can perform bulk data entry efficiently.\n\nFeature13: As a user, I want the system to perform validation immediately after a data upload (e.g., required fields present, formats correct) so that I know whether the upload succeeded.\n\nFeature14: As a user, I want to see a clear list of validation errors after an upload so that I understand exactly what needs to be fixed.\n\nFeature15: As a user, I want to be able to download an error report for failed uploads so that I can fix issues offline and re-upload.\n\nFeature16: As a user, I want to correct data that failed validation and re-upload the file so that I can complete the import without manual re-entry.\n\nFeature17: As a user, I want to be able to edit individual fields (single-record edits) directly on the data entry screen so that I can make quick corrections without using a file upload.\n\nFeature18: As a user, I want a “clone last period” (or copy/paste) capability between companies or periods so that I can quickly create new records based on existing data and then adjust as needed.\n\nFeature19: As a user, I want a basic review/approval step before data changes are finalized so that someone can confirm updates before they are used in reporting.\n\nFeature20: As a user, I want reports to be generated only from approved/finalized data so that report outputs are reliable.\n\nFeature21: As a user, I want a simple workflow status around data changes (e.g., pending review vs approved) rather than complex multi-step statuses so that the process remains lightweight.\n\nFeature22: As a user, I want to trigger cloning of data manually via a button or action so that I have control over when data is copied.\n\nFeature23: As a user, I want to trigger report generation manually via a button or action so that reports are created when I need them.\n\nFeature24: As a user, I want automatic validation to run immediately after each manual upload so that I get instant feedback on the upload’s success.\n\nFeature25: As a user, I want any configuration or settings changes (such as company list, currencies, or period definitions) to take effect immediately upon save so that I don’t have to manage a separate publishing step.\n\nFeature26: As a user, I want a confirmation prompt for settings changes that could affect existing data so that I don’t accidentally introduce breaking changes.\n\nFeature27: As a user, I want clearly separated navigation sections for Data Entry, Comparison, Reports, and Settings so that I can quickly find the area I need.\n\nFeature28: As a user, I want to quickly pick a company and period from a list to access its detailed financial view so that I can navigate efficiently.\n\nFeature29: As a user, I want to open a detailed company-period view by clicking a row in a company or period list so that moving from summary to detail is straightforward.\n\nFeature30: As a user, when I return from a detail view to the list, I want my filters and scroll position preserved so that I don’t lose my place.\n\nFeature31: As a user, I want an optional company/period switcher in the header so that I can change context without always going back to the list.\n\nFeature32: As a user, I want searches, page loads, and company/period switching to feel fast and responsive so that working in the dashboard is efficient.\n\nFeature33: As a user, I want a Company Comparison section that allows me to compare financial metrics (e.g., revenue, expenses, profit, margin) across multiple companies and periods so that I can analyze relative performance. (TBD: exact comparison views and metrics)\n\nFeature34: As a user, I want a Reports section where I can generate and view financial reports per company and across companies so that I can share and review performance. (TBD: specific report formats and layouts)\n\nFeature35: As a user, I want the system to support manual data entry as well as CSV/Excel uploads as initial data sources so that I can get started without external integrations.\n\nFeature36: As a user, I want basic user accounts with at least two roles (admin and standard) so that access and permissions can be controlled at a basic level.\n\nFeature37: As an admin, I want to manage which users have admin vs standard roles so that I can control who can change settings or approve data.\n\nFeature38: As a user, I want changes to company-period financial records to capture who made the change and when so that I have basic auditing capability.\n\nFeature39: As a user, I want approvals on company-period records to capture who approved and when so that approval history is traceable.\n\nFeature40: As a user, I want company and period-based data lookups and comparisons to be fast so that the dashboard remains responsive even as data grows.\n\nFeature41: As a user, I want to search and filter companies by name, ID, and active/inactive status so that I can quickly find the entities I need.\n\nFeature42: As a user, I want the dashboard to use a standard, high-contrast light theme by default so that the interface is clean and readable.\n\nFeature43: As a user, I want dark mode to be optional rather than required so that it does not delay initial delivery.
