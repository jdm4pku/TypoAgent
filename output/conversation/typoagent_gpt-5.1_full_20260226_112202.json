The user requirements list is as follows:\n\nFeature1: As a user, I want to create, edit, and organize diagrams to visually express ideas using nodes/shapes, connectors, and labels.\n\nFeature2: As a user, I want to directly manipulate diagram elements with a live preview so that dragging, resizing, connecting, and styling updates are shown immediately.\n\nFeature3: As a user, I want to drag and drop nodes/sections smoothly, with clear drop targets and snap-to-grid, so rearranging elements feels precise and responsive.\n\nFeature4: As a user, I want zoom and pan controls in the editor so I can navigate and focus on specific parts of large diagrams.\n\nFeature5: As a user, I want undo/redo support for my diagram edits so I can safely experiment and revert changes step by step.\n\nFeature6: As a user, I want basic alignment guides (e.g., smart guides while dragging) so I can line up shapes neatly without manual fine-tuning.\n\nFeature7: As a user, I want optional auto-layout for diagrams so the system can arrange nodes and connectors for me when needed.\n\nFeature8: As a user, I want quick preview controls for theme/colors, line styles, fonts, and spacing so I can adjust the diagram’s overall look without leaving the editor.\n\nFeature9: As a user, I want toggles for grid, snap-to-grid, and alignment guides in the preview/editor so I can choose between precise alignment and a freer layout.\n\nFeature10: As a user, I want to switch between different auto-layout modes and tweak node spacing and flow direction so I can quickly reshape the structure of the diagram.\n\nFeature11: As a user, I want a simple sample-data panel (e.g., labels/values) that updates the diagram instantly so I can see how real content will look.\n\nFeature12: As a user, I want text inside diagram elements to support simple labels with basic formatting (font size, weight, and color) so content is readable without rich-text complexity.\n\nFeature13: As a user, I want live preview behavior to be available while I’m editing diagrams so I can see the impact of my changes in real time.\n\nFeature14: As a user, I want at least a simple read-only/share preview of diagrams so I can quickly show others what a diagram will look like without giving edit access.\n\nFeature15: As a user, I want an export preview (e.g., before saving to PNG/SVG/PDF) so I can confirm the diagram’s layout and appearance before exporting.\n\nFeature16: As a user, I want basic media import from local files so I can include simple images or assets in diagrams if needed.\n\nFeature17: As a user, I want to export diagrams to common formats such as PNG and SVG, and optionally PDF, so I can share or embed them elsewhere.\n\nFeature18: As a user, I want diagram organization to be simple, with at least a list view and search so I can quickly find diagrams by name or keywords.\n\nFeature19: As a user, I want optional folders or tags for diagrams so I can group related diagrams without a complex hierarchy.\n\nFeature20: As a user, I want built-in diagram templates for flowcharts so I can quickly start standard process diagrams.\n\nFeature21: As a user, I want built-in diagram templates for mind maps so I can quickly capture and structure ideas.\n\nFeature22: As a user, I want built-in diagram templates for org charts so I can represent organizational structures easily.\n\nFeature23: As a user, I want basic UML templates (e.g., class and sequence diagrams) so I can sketch simple software designs when needed.\n\nFeature24: As a user, I want a simple network diagram template so I can outline basic system or infrastructure layouts.\n\nFeature25: As a user, I want to duplicate an existing diagram to use it as a starting point so I can reuse structures without maintaining custom template infrastructure.\n\nFeature26: As a user, I want to build diagrams out of individual elements (nodes/shapes/connectors) that I can add, remove, and rearrange easily so I can iteratively refine my ideas.\n\nFeature27: As a user, I want nodes/shapes to support labels and simple properties like color or status so I can visually encode meaning in the diagram.\n\nFeature28: As a user, I want a clean, light default color palette with slate-gray nodes, connectors, and labels so the diagrams look neutral and easy to read.\n\nFeature29: As a user, I want a simple blue accent color for highlights and selections so I can clearly see what is active or selected.\n\nFeature30: As a user, I want sufficient contrast between text/lines and the canvas so diagrams remain comfortably readable without strict accessibility configuration on my part.\n\nFeature31: As a user, I want hover and selected/active states to be clearly visible so I always know which element I am about to interact with or currently editing.\n\nFeature32: As a user, I want obvious error states when an action fails (e.g., invalid connector, save error) so I can understand when and where something went wrong.\n\nFeature33: As a user, I want the diagram canvas to use a ghost-white/off-white background so the content stands out and is comfortable to view.\n\nFeature34: As a user, I want an optional subtle light-gray grid on the canvas so I can align elements visually without a distracting background.\n\nFeature35: As a user, I want a dark theme (if provided) to switch the canvas to a dark charcoal background so lines and labels still pop in low-light conditions.\n\nFeature36: As a user, I want UI panels and sidebars to use clean, neutral colors (white or slightly tinted off-white) so they don’t distract from the canvas.\n\nFeature37: As a user, I want the overall UI to look clean and consistent enough that it doesn’t interfere with editing diagrams, without requiring elaborate branding or typography systems.",
