Below is the FULL current conversation context:
{history_str}

{scope_intro}
{candidates_block}

Within this scope only, based on the current dialogue context, decide which candidates are more important or relevant. Assign an INTEGER score for every {id_field} listed above (higher = higher priority; scores only rank within this scope). Output JSON ONLY:
{{
  "scores": [
    {{"{id_field}": "...", "score": 80}},
    {{"{id_field}": "...", "score": 60}}
  ]
}}
Make sure the scores array contains ALL {id_field} values listed above.
