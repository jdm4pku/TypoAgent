Two-level taxonomy (Layer1: Layer2 nodes):
{skeleton_text}

New Instruction:
{instruction}

Task:
1) Identify which Layer2 subcategories (from the taxonomy above) the instruction touches.
2) For each: if instruction describes in detail → output clarifying key-question; if only mentions → output at most one "Do you need [X]?" question.
3) Return the strict JSON (relevant_dimensions) specified in the system instructions.
4) Omit topics the instruction does not mention.
