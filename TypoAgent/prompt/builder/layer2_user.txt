Current Tree (Layer 1 fixed, Layer 2 mutable):
{current_file_content}

New Instruction:
{instruction}

Task:
1) Extract requirement points from the instruction into Interaction / Content / Style. Remember: data, records, reports, analytics, documentation, templates → Content; user actions/flows → Interaction.
2) Integrate them into the current tree using the policy (merge > expand > add). Prefer merging into existing; avoid adding new Interaction dimensions if the tree already has many.
3) Output the strict JSON specified in the system instructions.
